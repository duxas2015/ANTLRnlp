# ANTLRnlp
ANTLRnlp is an independent study by Emily Coleman in her senior year at the College of Charleston.
It is an exploration of formal grammars, language parsers, and the structure of the English language.
The end goal is to use ANTLR 4 to parse an English sentence into a phrase structure tree, disregarding challenges presented by ambiguity.
